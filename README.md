2. Vector3D_AlgeOprTest- Implementation of unit test project for the class library.
3. CrossProduct_WPF_App- Implementation of a WPF desktop application that uses the class library to compute the cross product of two 3D vectors.

The project is implemented with the following constraints:
▪ Visual Studio 2022
▪ C# language
